# Week 1: ETL Process for Indian Agriculture Data Analysis  

## **Objective**  
The goal of this project is to analyze Indian agricultural data using Power BI. Week 1 focuses on preparing the dataset for analysis through the ETL (Extraction, Transformation, and Loading) process.  

## **Dataset**
*Dataset:* Contains 19 years of Indian agricultural data, including information on states, districts, crops, seasons, area, and production.  
*Size:* 73,827 rows and 12 columns (including blank and unnecessary columns).  
*Format:* CSV file.  

## **Steps Performed in Week 1**  
1. *Installation and Exploration of Power BI:*  
   - Installed Power BI and explored its features.  

2. *Dataset Extraction:*  
   - Imported the CSV file into Power BI using the **Get Data** option.  

3. *Data Cleaning:*  
   - Removed blank columns and unnecessary rows.  
   - Checked for and addressed missing values.  

4. *Data Transformation:*  
   - Standardized column names (lowercase, underscores). 

5. *Data Loading:* 
   - Loaded the cleaned and transformed dataset into Power BI.  
   - Saved the project as `ExhaustiveAnalysisOnIndianAgriculture.pbix`.
